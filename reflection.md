- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Yuhan, Lois 
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    Tues Sept 23 2025 TA hours with Sofia 
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    Surprised there is no direct list function/type in Java, the need to specify types is pretty annoying to be honest but I understand why it can be helpful. I also did not enjoy needing to convert from String to String[] to ArrayList<String> and back, perhaps there's a different method that could be used but with my Java knowledge and asking the TAs this is was the best choice. 
    What I did like was that the usage of methods was pretty easy to implement and test. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    I don't have any great conclusions. Java is much less intuitive than Python for me and I find it quite difficult to think about in terms of classes and types and methods. But I'm sure it's great for the computer! 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Going to TA hours was fun because not only were there wonderful TAs who could help but there were also other students who were struggling with me. I found that quite helpful, both in terms of completing the assignment and in terms of morale. 
    What didn't work was using the String methods and trying to use replaceAll() because I felt like it was too finicky and difficult to work with in terms of needing to search for bugs and hard code the bugs out and I felt it was quite repetitive. However, maybe a smarter person than I could've done it I was simply already using the Map and felt that was the most intuitive method for me. 
    Some advice I would give is ask for help! I hate asking for help and I did it! It was really helpful! Another thing is to use the Java documentation for everything, it's very extensive and has some great resources, same with w3schools and basically just Googling things was very helpful.
